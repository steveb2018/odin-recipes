    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a recipe for sandwiches detailing the ingredients and the steps
      required to make it. <strong>Note:</strong> this only works with pre-made
      and pre-packaged ingredients that <em>do not</em> need to be heated.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Bread of your choice.</li>
      <li>Fillings of your choice.</li>
      <li>Optional: Condiments of your choice.</li>
      <li>Optional: Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Seperate two slices of bread - if not seperated already. Designate one
        slice as the upper side and the other slice as the lower side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: Spread butter onto the inside of one or both slices of bread.
        Leave the outside of both slices plain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place fillings on top of the inside of the lower slice of bread.
        <strong>Note:</strong> it's better to put soggier fillings such as
        tomatos in between other fillings, this will prevent you getting a soggy
        sandwich that breaks the second you pick it up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: Place any condiments onto the inside of the upper slice of
        bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the upper slice of bread on top of the fillings, ensuring that the
        inside of slice touches the fillings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: Cut sandwich into pieces, cut horizontally for two rectangle
        halves, cut again vertically if you'd like four square quarters, or cut
        vertically if you'd like two triangle halves, and vertically again but
        from the other corner if you'd like four triangle quarters.
      </li>
    </ol>
