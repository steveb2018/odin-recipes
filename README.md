# odin-recipes

This is a simple recipe website

This website demonstrates the following that I have learnt about web development via the Odin Project Foundations Course:

- The HTML boilerplate
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Strong and Emphasised text
- Links and Paths (relative and absolute)
- Lists (Ordered and Unordered)
- Images
